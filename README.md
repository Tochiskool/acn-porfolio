# Welcome to my Official portfolio.

- My intention is to create a portfolio where my projects will be in a data base. The projects will be fetched by type and I will expose all the contacts I get and maybe make our conversation visible to employees and collegues depending on what they select when contacting me. I think it is going to be an exciting journey with so much to accomplish.

## Hosting site.

I will host the app on Vercel because Vercel handles non static web applications better that muy traditional nestlify.
###Â My Stack

- I will be using the **Mern stack** and will try to make my code as clean, readable, modular and prioritising the mobile first techniques using Advanced Css stylesl and Tailwind.

#### My Stack

```txt
- MongoDB
- Express
- React
- Node
```

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
